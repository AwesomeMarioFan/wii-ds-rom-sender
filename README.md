# wii-ds-rom-sender
This application will allow you to send NDS ROMs via a Wii to a DS using Download Play.  
Please note that if your DS is not patched with FlashMe and you dont use HaxxStation then you can only send over Official Demo ROMs.  
To make use of HaxxStation, get the US version of "DS Download Station - Volume 1" renamed to "haxxstation.nds" on the root of your sd card.  
All you have to do is put your .nds/.srl files into a "srl" folder on your sd card, 
get the current version of this program from the "releases" tab and start it via the homebrew channel.  
After it loaded up just select the file you want, download it on your DS and play it!
